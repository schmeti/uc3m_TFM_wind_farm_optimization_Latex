	abstract = {The use of machine-learning methods helps to improve decision-making in different fields. In particular, the idea of bridging predictions (predictive models) and prescriptions (optimization problems) is gaining attention within the scientific community. One of the main ideas to address this trade-off is the Constraint Learning (CL) methodology, where the structure of the machine learning model can be treated as a set of constraints to be embedded within the optimization problem, establishing the relationship between a direct decision variable x and a response variable y. However, most CL approaches have focused on making point predictions, not considering the statistical and external uncertainty faced in the modeling process. In this paper, we extend the CL methodology to deal with uncertainty in the response variable y. The novel Distributional Constraint Learning (DCL) methodology makes use of a piece-wise linearizable neural network-based model to estimate the parameters of the conditional distribution of y (dependent on decisions x and contextual information), which can be embedded within mixed-integer optimization problems. In particular, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem by sampling random values from the estimated distribution by using a linear set of constraints. In this sense, DCL combines both the predictive performance of the neural network method and the possibility of generating scenarios to account for uncertainty within a tractable optimization model. The behavior of the proposed methodology is tested in the context of electricity systems, where a Virtual Power Plant seeks to optimize its operation, subject to different forms of uncertainty, and with price-responsive consumers.}

If however data on feasible and/or infeasible states are available, these data can be used to learn the constraints. The benefits of this approach are clearly seen, however, there is a need for this process to be carried out in a structured manner. This paper, therefore, provides a framework for Optimization with Constraint Learning (OCL) which we believe will help to formalize and direct the process of learning constraints from data. This framework includes the following steps: (i) setup of the conceptual optimization model, (ii) data gathering and preprocessing, (iii) selection and training of predictive models, (iv) resolution of the optimization model, and (v) verification and improvement of the optimization model. We then review the recent OCL literature in light of this framework and highlight current trends, as well as areas for future research.}

Its parameters were estimated by fitting the predictions of a detailed explicit kinematic wake model for a wide range of wind velocities, number of turbines utilized, relative distances of turbines and various types of commercial wind turbines. An empirical model was used to represent the turbine power curve. The turbine grid adopted was the uniform one, where each individual machine is equally placed between its neighbours. The proposed short-cut model represented the full model in a quite satisfactory way and it was presented in a suitable formulation for dealing with wind park preliminary design problems. The effect of wind direction was also taken into consideration and was properly analysed.}

	abstract = {Wind turbine wakes have been studied by analysing a large set of atomospheric data, from a wind farm with four turbines sited on a flat coastal area. The results obtained have been generalized to allow tests against data from other full scale wind turbines as well as wind tunnel simulations. These comparisons are found to give very satisfactory results. Most results refer to single turbine wakes. The thrust coefficient, CT, is found to be a better parameter for description of wake characteristics than wind speed, because it implicitly includes the effect of regulation. It is also found that down wind travel time is more convenient to use than down wind distance in this context. The travel time, t0, to the end of the near-wake region, i.e. to the point where a single velocity deficit peak first appears, is found to be inversely proportional to the rotational frequency of the turbine and to the turbulence intensity of the ambient air flow and proportional to the ratio of the wake radius and the hub height. For larger travel times, i.e. for the far-wake region, it is found that the centreline relative velocity deficit decreases with the logarithm of the time travelled and is parametrically dependent on t0 and CT. The combined wake of two turbines aligned with the wind direction is found to have a lower relative velocity deficit than the wake of a single turbine for the same travel time. This is explained by the inverse relation between t0 and turbulence intensity, the latter being much higher in the double wake, initially.}

		abstract = {There is more wind with less turbulence offshore compared with an onshore case, which drives the development of the offshore wind farm worldwide. Since a huge amount of money is required for constructing an offshore wind farm, many types of research have been done on the optimization of the offshore wind farm with the purpose of either minimizing the cost of energy or maximizing the total energy production. There are several factors that have an impact on the performance of the wind farm, mainly energy production of wind farm which is highly decided by the wind condition of construction area and micro-siting of wind turbines (WTs), as well as initial investment which is influenced by both the placement of WTs and the electrical system design, especially the scheme of cable connection layout. In this paper, a review of the state-of-art researches related to the wind farm layout optimization as well as electrical system design including cable connection scheme optimization is presented. The most significant factors that should be considered in the offshore wind farm optimization work is highlighted after reviewing the latest works, and the future needs have been specified.},

		abstract = {A multi-objective optimization method utilizing genetic algorithms is developed to optimize wind farm layout design with the dual objectives of enhancing the production of wind power and reducing hour-level intermittency in the generated power. This method introduces a novel metric for annual wind power intermittency based on the transition probability of wind conditions (i.e., speed and direction). The present multi-objective optimization method ensures that Pareto optimal layouts are evenly distributed according to multiple cost function values. To mitigate wind power intermittency, the spatial distribution of wake fields is strategically manipulated to counteract hourly fluctuations in wind conditions. In wind conditions favoring high power generation, it is found that increasing the overlap between wakes and turbines helps to minimize disparities in generated power compared to other wind conditions.}

	abstract = {The arrangement of wind turbines in clusters presents two noteworthy issues: (1) diminished power generation brought about by wake wind speed deficits and (2) expanded unique loads on the blades caused by higher turbulence levels. The drop in power generation of downstream wind turbines can reach up to 46% of the upstream wind turbines in entirely created wake conditions. Thus, wind farm layout optimisation is an essential design criterion of a wind farm. Focusing on optimising the micro-position of the turbines within the wind farm to minimise the wake effects can maximise the expected power output. There are several crucial aspects in designing a wind farm layout, and most of the previous studies have been focusing on maximising the overall energy yield and minimise the initial investment. Several optimisation methods based on heuristic techniques have successfully found optimal solution to these challenges. However, far too little attention has been paid on comparing these methodologies to each other. Therefore, this work aims to survey the existing approaches used to-date in solving the wind turbine positioning within the wind farm. This work firstly briefs the historical background of the conventional development of a wind farm. Then, key features and basic components of a wind farm modelling are discussed and categorised into the following: wind farm siting, layout design, wake models and objective functions. Several research gaps and suggestion of future research areas in this field are highlighted which shall enable to guide researchers to explore further in the upcoming studies.}

Since the wake effect can have a serious impact on wind turbine (WT) performance, the development of accurate WT wake models is essential for the optimal design and control of wind farms. A comprehensive review of wake modeling in WT will provide an understanding the strengths and limitations of wake models, leading to the development of more accurate and cost-effective models that are better suited to meet the operational challenges of wind farms. This review investigates the whole evolution process of WT wake models, focusing on the modeling process and application prospects. The review analyzes different wake modeling methods and explores the evolution laws of wake models. On this basis, the evolution, categorization and comparison of wake models are discussed based on the environmental characteristics of mountainous and deep-sea complex wind farms and the structural characteristics of WT, along with the prospects and potential improvements of WT wake models for complex environments. In addition, it discusses the latest research on the practical application of WT wake models, emphasizing the importance of the wake effect in the design of WT and in the construction and application of wind farms. Finally, it summarizes the limitations inherent in wake-related studies of WT, proposing potential strategies to overcome these challenges. Through systematic analysis, this review aims to deepen the understanding of WT wake effects and promote the further development of wind power technology.}

The machine learning wake model is trained using well-validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation data, and consists of thousands of sub-models, each of which is an artificial neural network (ANN) wake model. The ANN wake models are trained separately for low-speed and high-speed inflows to ensure high accuracy of the predictions, with less than 2% error compared to CFD simulations. The accuracy and efficiency of the framework are validated, and the results show better agreement with CFD simulation than an analytical wake model developed in recent years. A parametric study on the number of wind turbines in the Horns Rev wind farm demonstrates that more wind turbines can be added with a minor decrease in average power, with more even and staggered layouts. Under full-wake uniform inflow, the selected analytical wake model exhibits a power prediction error of 5%–8%, while the differences between optimal layouts searched by different wake models range from 2% to 8%. When introducing a wider range of inflow direction sectors, the discrepancy between optimal layout performances decreases.}
