	abstract = {The use of machine-learning methods helps to improve decision-making in different fields. In particular, the idea of bridging predictions (predictive models) and prescriptions (optimization problems) is gaining attention within the scientific community. One of the main ideas to address this trade-off is the Constraint Learning (CL) methodology, where the structure of the machine learning model can be treated as a set of constraints to be embedded within the optimization problem, establishing the relationship between a direct decision variable x and a response variable y. However, most CL approaches have focused on making point predictions, not considering the statistical and external uncertainty faced in the modeling process. In this paper, we extend the CL methodology to deal with uncertainty in the response variable y. The novel Distributional Constraint Learning (DCL) methodology makes use of a piece-wise linearizable neural network-based model to estimate the parameters of the conditional distribution of y (dependent on decisions x and contextual information), which can be embedded within mixed-integer optimization problems. In particular, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem by sampling random values from the estimated distribution by using a linear set of constraints. In this sense, DCL combines both the predictive performance of the neural network method and the possibility of generating scenarios to account for uncertainty within a tractable optimization model. The behavior of the proposed methodology is tested in the context of electricity systems, where a Virtual Power Plant seeks to optimize its operation, subject to different forms of uncertainty, and with price-responsive consumers.}

If however data on feasible and/or infeasible states are available, these data can be used to learn the constraints. The benefits of this approach are clearly seen, however, there is a need for this process to be carried out in a structured manner. This paper, therefore, provides a framework for Optimization with Constraint Learning (OCL) which we believe will help to formalize and direct the process of learning constraints from data. This framework includes the following steps: (i) setup of the conceptual optimization model, (ii) data gathering and preprocessing, (iii) selection and training of predictive models, (iv) resolution of the optimization model, and (v) verification and improvement of the optimization model. We then review the recent OCL literature in light of this framework and highlight current trends, as well as areas for future research.}

Its parameters were estimated by fitting the predictions of a detailed explicit kinematic wake model for a wide range of wind velocities, number of turbines utilized, relative distances of turbines and various types of commercial wind turbines. An empirical model was used to represent the turbine power curve. The turbine grid adopted was the uniform one, where each individual machine is equally placed between its neighbours. The proposed short-cut model represented the full model in a quite satisfactory way and it was presented in a suitable formulation for dealing with wind park preliminary design problems. The effect of wind direction was also taken into consideration and was properly analysed.}

	abstract = {Wind turbine wakes have been studied by analysing a large set of atomospheric data, from a wind farm with four turbines sited on a flat coastal area. The results obtained have been generalized to allow tests against data from other full scale wind turbines as well as wind tunnel simulations. These comparisons are found to give very satisfactory results. Most results refer to single turbine wakes. The thrust coefficient, CT, is found to be a better parameter for description of wake characteristics than wind speed, because it implicitly includes the effect of regulation. It is also found that down wind travel time is more convenient to use than down wind distance in this context. The travel time, t0, to the end of the near-wake region, i.e. to the point where a single velocity deficit peak first appears, is found to be inversely proportional to the rotational frequency of the turbine and to the turbulence intensity of the ambient air flow and proportional to the ratio of the wake radius and the hub height. For larger travel times, i.e. for the far-wake region, it is found that the centreline relative velocity deficit decreases with the logarithm of the time travelled and is parametrically dependent on t0 and CT. The combined wake of two turbines aligned with the wind direction is found to have a lower relative velocity deficit than the wake of a single turbine for the same travel time. This is explained by the inverse relation between t0 and turbulence intensity, the latter being much higher in the double wake, initially.}

		abstract = {There is more wind with less turbulence offshore compared with an onshore case, which drives the development of the offshore wind farm worldwide. Since a huge amount of money is required for constructing an offshore wind farm, many types of research have been done on the optimization of the offshore wind farm with the purpose of either minimizing the cost of energy or maximizing the total energy production. There are several factors that have an impact on the performance of the wind farm, mainly energy production of wind farm which is highly decided by the wind condition of construction area and micro-siting of wind turbines (WTs), as well as initial investment which is influenced by both the placement of WTs and the electrical system design, especially the scheme of cable connection layout. In this paper, a review of the state-of-art researches related to the wind farm layout optimization as well as electrical system design including cable connection scheme optimization is presented. The most significant factors that should be considered in the offshore wind farm optimization work is highlighted after reviewing the latest works, and the future needs have been specified.},

This method introduces a novel metric for annual wind power intermittency based on the transition probability of wind conditions (i.e., speed and direction). The present multi-objective optimization method ensures that Pareto optimal layouts are evenly distributed according to multiple cost function values. To mitigate wind power intermittency, the spatial distribution of wake fields is strategically manipulated to counteract hourly fluctuations in wind conditions. In wind conditions favoring high power generation, it is found that increasing the overlap between wakes and turbines helps to minimize disparities in generated power compared to other wind conditions.}

The drop in power generation of downstream wind turbines can reach up to 46% of the upstream wind turbines in entirely created wake conditions. Thus, wind farm layout optimisation is an essential design criterion of a wind farm. Focusing on optimising the micro-position of the turbines within the wind farm to minimise the wake effects can maximise the expected power output. There are several crucial aspects in designing a wind farm layout, and most of the previous studies have been focusing on maximising the overall energy yield and minimise the initial investment. Several optimisation methods based on heuristic techniques have successfully found optimal solution to these challenges. However, far too little attention has been paid on comparing these methodologies to each other. Therefore, this work aims to survey the existing approaches used to-date in solving the wind turbine positioning within the wind farm. This work firstly briefs the historical background of the conventional development of a wind farm. Then, key features and basic components of a wind farm modelling are discussed and categorised into the following: wind farm siting, layout design, wake models and objective functions. Several research gaps and suggestion of future research areas in this field are highlighted which shall enable to guide researchers to explore further in the upcoming studies.}

Since the wake effect can have a serious impact on wind turbine (WT) performance, the development of accurate WT wake models is essential for the optimal design and control of wind farms. A comprehensive review of wake modeling in WT will provide an understanding the strengths and limitations of wake models, leading to the development of more accurate and cost-effective models that are better suited to meet the operational challenges of wind farms. This review investigates the whole evolution process of WT wake models, focusing on the modeling process and application prospects. The review analyzes different wake modeling methods and explores the evolution laws of wake models. On this basis, the evolution, categorization and comparison of wake models are discussed based on the environmental characteristics of mountainous and deep-sea complex wind farms and the structural characteristics of WT, along with the prospects and potential improvements of WT wake models for complex environments. In addition, it discusses the latest research on the practical application of WT wake models, emphasizing the importance of the wake effect in the design of WT and in the construction and application of wind farms. Finally, it summarizes the limitations inherent in wake-related studies of WT, proposing potential strategies to overcome these challenges. Through systematic analysis, this review aims to deepen the understanding of WT wake effects and promote the further development of wind power technology.}

The machine learning wake model is trained using well-validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation data, and consists of thousands of sub-models, each of which is an artificial neural network (ANN) wake model. The ANN wake models are trained separately for low-speed and high-speed inflows to ensure high accuracy of the predictions, with less than 2% error compared to CFD simulations. The accuracy and efficiency of the framework are validated, and the results show better agreement with CFD simulation than an analytical wake model developed in recent years. A parametric study on the number of wind turbines in the Horns Rev wind farm demonstrates that more wind turbines can be added with a minor decrease in average power, with more even and staggered layouts. Under full-wake uniform inflow, the selected analytical wake model exhibits a power prediction error of 5%–8%, while the differences between optimal layouts searched by different wake models range from 2% to 8%. When introducing a wider range of inflow direction sectors, the discrepancy between optimal layout performances decreases.}

	abstract = {In the paper, a novel framework that employs the machine learning and CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation to develop new wake velocity and turbulence models with high accuracy and good efficiency is proposed to improve the turbine wake predictions. An ANN (artificial neural network) model based on the back-propagation (BP) algorithm is designed to build the underlying spatial relationship between the inflow conditions and the three-dimensional wake flows. To save the computational cost, a reduced-order turbine model ADM-R (actuator disk model with rotation), is incorporated into RANS (Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations) simulations coupled with a modified k-ε turbulence model to provide big datasets of wake flow for training, testing, and validation of the ANN model. The numerical framework of RANS/ADM-R simulations is validated by a standalone Vestas V80 2 MW wind turbine and NTNU wind tunnel test of double aligned turbines. In the ANN-based wake model, the inflow wind speed and turbulence intensity at hub height are selected as input variables, while the spatial velocity deficit and added turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) in wake field are taken as output variables. The ANN-based wake model is first deployed to a standalone turbine, and then the spatial wake characteristics and power generation of an aligned 8-turbine row as representation of Horns Rev wind farm are also validated against Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and field measurement. The results of ANN-based wake model show good agreement with the numerical simulations and measurement data, indicating that the ANN is capable of establishing the complex spatial relationship between inflow conditions and the wake flows. The machine learning techniques can remarkably improve the accuracy and efficiency of wake predictions.}

	abstract = {In the wind industry, power prediction of wind farm is commonly implemented by analytical wake models, which is low-cost but insufficient in accuracy for high-turbulent wake modelling. In this study, a novel machine-learning-based wake model is developed to improve the power prediction of wind farms. The presented model can reproduce the velocity and turbulence fields in turbine wakes commensurate to the high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations while achieving good computational efficiency. Driven by massive CFD simulation dataset, the implicit relationship between inflows and wake flows is established using the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) technique based on back-propagation algorithm. The reduced-order method Actuator Disk Model with Rotation (ADM-R) and modified k−ε turbulence model are implemented into RANS simulations to save the computational costs dramatically in producing the big-data of wake flows. The ANN wake model is deployed in the Horn Rev wind farm, and validated against LES, onsite measurement, and analytical wake models. The conclusions show that the ANN model can appreciably improve the power predictions compared with the existing analytical models and match the LES and measurement data well. The validated model is also adopted to investigate the influence of wind direction and turbine layout on power production of wind farms.}

		abstract = {Two-stage stochastic programming is a popular framework for optimization under uncertainty, where decision variables are split between first-stage decisions, and second-stage (or recourse) decisions, with the latter being adjusted after uncertainty is realized. These problems are often formulated using Sample Average Approximation (SAA), where uncertainty is modeled as a finite set of scenarios, resulting in a large “monolithic” problem, i.e., where the model is repeated for each scenario. The resulting models can be challenging to solve, and several problem-specific decomposition approaches have been proposed. An alternative approach is to approximate the expected second-stage objective value using a surrogate model, which can then be embedded in the first-stage problem to produce good heuristic solutions. In this work, we propose to instead model the distribution of the second-stage objective, specifically using a quantile neural network. Embedding this distributional approximation enables capturing uncertainty and is not limited to expected-value optimization, e.g., the proposed approach enables optimization of the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). We discuss optimization formulations for embedding the quantile neural network and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using several computational case studies including a set of mixed-integer optimization problems.}

		title = {Robust wind farm layout optimization},
		journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
		abstract = {Wake interactions in wind farms cause losses in annual energy production (AEP) on the order of 10%. Wind farm designers optimize the layout of the farm to mitigate wake losses, especially in the dominant site-specific wind directions. As wind turbines and wind farms grow in scale, optimization becomes more complex. Offshore wind farms regularly comprise more than 100 wind turbines and are characterized by complex boundaries due to shipping lanes, neighboring wind farms, and other constraints.
		
		Layout optimization methods are broadly split between gradient-based and gradient-free approaches. Gradient-based approaches can converge quickly and perform well for smaller, academic problems but are often sensitive to initial conditions and tuning parameters and require expert knowledge to use. On the other hand, gradient-free approaches can be more robust to problem complexities. We present a robust layout optimization approach based on a random search algorithm. The algorithm is intended for those who are not optimization experts and has few tuning parameters that need specification to achieve satisfactory results. Unlike off-the-shelf methods, which use generally available, non-domain-specific optimization routines that accept as inputs an optimization function and constraint definitions, this approach takes advantage of the relative computational costs of the different evaluations by evaluating cheaper computations first (boundary and minimum distance constraints) and running expensive AEP evaluations only if all other checks pass. Moreover, an outer genetic algorithm allows multiple solutions to evolve in parallel, enabling rapid solution development on high-performance computers. We discuss the relative ease of selecting necessary tuning parameters and demonstrate the efficacy of the genetic random search on a complex layout problem consisting of placing 70 turbines in a nonconvex and unconnected boundary region.}
