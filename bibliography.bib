	abstract = {The use of machine-learning methods helps to improve decision-making in different fields. In particular, the idea of bridging predictions (predictive models) and prescriptions (optimization problems) is gaining attention within the scientific community. One of the main ideas to address this trade-off is the Constraint Learning (CL) methodology, where the structure of the machine learning model can be treated as a set of constraints to be embedded within the optimization problem, establishing the relationship between a direct decision variable x and a response variable y. However, most CL approaches have focused on making point predictions, not considering the statistical and external uncertainty faced in the modeling process. In this paper, we extend the CL methodology to deal with uncertainty in the response variable y. The novel Distributional Constraint Learning (DCL) methodology makes use of a piece-wise linearizable neural network-based model to estimate the parameters of the conditional distribution of y (dependent on decisions x and contextual information), which can be embedded within mixed-integer optimization problems. In particular, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem by sampling random values from the estimated distribution by using a linear set of constraints. In this sense, DCL combines both the predictive performance of the neural network method and the possibility of generating scenarios to account for uncertainty within a tractable optimization model. The behavior of the proposed methodology is tested in the context of electricity systems, where a Virtual Power Plant seeks to optimize its operation, subject to different forms of uncertainty, and with price-responsive consumers.}

	abstract = {Many real-life optimization problems frequently contain one or more constraints or objectives for which there are no explicit formulae. If however data on feasible and/or infeasible states are available, these data can be used to learn the constraints. The benefits of this approach are clearly seen, however, there is a need for this process to be carried out in a structured manner. This paper, therefore, provides a framework for Optimization with Constraint Learning (OCL) which we believe will help to formalize and direct the process of learning constraints from data. This framework includes the following steps: (i) setup of the conceptual optimization model, (ii) data gathering and preprocessing, (iii) selection and training of predictive models, (iv) resolution of the optimization model, and (v) verification and improvement of the optimization model. We then review the recent OCL literature in light of this framework and highlight current trends, as well as areas for future research.}

	abstract = {A short-cut model suitable for the estimation of the overall wind park efficiency was developed. Its parameters were estimated by fitting the predictions of a detailed explicit kinematic wake model for a wide range of wind velocities, number of turbines utilized, relative distances of turbines and various types of commercial wind turbines. An empirical model was used to represent the turbine power curve. The turbine grid adopted was the uniform one, where each individual machine is equally placed between its neighbours. The proposed short-cut model represented the full model in a quite satisfactory way and it was presented in a suitable formulation for dealing with wind park preliminary design problems. The effect of wind direction was also taken into consideration and was properly analysed.}

	abstract = {Wind turbine wakes have been studied by analysing a large set of atomospheric data, from a wind farm with four turbines sited on a flat coastal area. The results obtained have been generalized to allow tests against data from other full scale wind turbines as well as wind tunnel simulations. These comparisons are found to give very satisfactory results. Most results refer to single turbine wakes. The thrust coefficient, CT, is found to be a better parameter for description of wake characteristics than wind speed, because it implicitly includes the effect of regulation. It is also found that down wind travel time is more convenient to use than down wind distance in this context. The travel time, t0, to the end of the near-wake region, i.e. to the point where a single velocity deficit peak first appears, is found to be inversely proportional to the rotational frequency of the turbine and to the turbulence intensity of the ambient air flow and proportional to the ratio of the wake radius and the hub height. For larger travel times, i.e. for the far-wake region, it is found that the centreline relative velocity deficit decreases with the logarithm of the time travelled and is parametrically dependent on t0 and CT. The combined wake of two turbines aligned with the wind direction is found to have a lower relative velocity deficit than the wake of a single turbine for the same travel time. This is explained by the inverse relation between t0 and turbulence intensity, the latter being much higher in the double wake, initially.}
