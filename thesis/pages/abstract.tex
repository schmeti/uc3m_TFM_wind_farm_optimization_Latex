This following Thesis combines mathematical Optimization with Constraint Learning to optimize relative wind turbine placement dicstance for two wind turbines performance in a predefined area under randomly distributed wind conditions. A Neural Network is trained on simulated data to model the impact of turbine positioning on power output. This model is embedded as a set of constraints in a mixed-integer optimization problem, and the problem evaluated for a current state-of-the-art wind farm configuration.
