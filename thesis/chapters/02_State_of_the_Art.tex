\chapter{State of the Art}\label{chapter:state_of_the_art}

Since the arrival of large-scale wind turbine farm operations as part of energy infrastructure, optimizing the positioning of the individual wind turbines relative to each other to mitigate wake effects and maximize the total power output is the subject of scientific investigation. As this Thesis is an attempt to apply a novel constraint learning method introduced in \cite{ALCANTARA2023120895} to the optimization of wind farm layouts, the following state-of-the-art is split into two pieces:  The first investigates the current relevant publications of wind farm optimization and the second one presents a brief introduction into recent developments in the field of constraint learning. 

\subsubsection{Optimization of Wind Farm Layouts}

As discussed in the introduction, one of the main goals in the optimization of wind farm layouts is to reduce the negative impact of wake effects between wind turbines \cite{KIM2024123383}. Historically, rule of thumb approaches were used by setting up the layout as a grid  with the distance between wind turbines, with spacing in the dominant wind direction between 8 and 12 times the turbine rotor diameter and spacing perpendicular to the dominant wind direction 4 to 6 times the turbine rotor diameter \cite{AZLAN2021110047} \cite{hou_review_2019}.

These methods have evolved to with pursuing the goal of maximizing the Annual Energy Production (AEP) of wind farms in the context of stochastic optimization as done in \cite{Sinner_2024} \cite{KIM2024123383}. 

The core of any of the most recent optimizations models is a wake model, which becomes part of the objective function to represent the wake effects on power output. These models can be categorized as \cite{WANG2024118508}: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Experimental Methods
	\item Numerical modeling
	\item Analytical/semi-empirical modeling
	\item Data-driven modeling
\end{enumerate}

While experimental methods and numerical models might be the most precise models available for wake modeling, one of the challenges that come with the optimization is that the model has to be able to be introduced into the current state-of-the-art solvers as part of an objective function, leading to the prevalent use of analytical wake models like the Gaussian wake model and the 3D wake model  \cite{WANG2024118508}. With advancements in Machine Learning, the field of data-driven modeling is meanwhile expanding, with successful attempts in introducing Neural Networks and other Machine Learning frameworks into optimizations of wind farm layouts. Generally, either experimental data or data from numerical modeling (more prevalent) is used to train  a chosen model type. The resulting model is then introduced into the optimization problem, as done in \cite{YANG2023119240} \cite{wes-9-869-2024} \cite{TI2020114025} \cite{TI2021618}. 

\subsubsection{Constraint Learning}

The term Constraint Learning, defined as "finding a set of constraints, a constraint theory, that satisfies a given dataset" in \cite{de2018learning}, is the intersection of machine learning and optimization or more in practical terms, the introduction of machine learning models into optimization problems as constraints. As the in Machine Learnin the models learn from a given data set, the constraints resulting from such a model are equally learned. \cite{de2018learning} 

For this Thesis specifically, we consider the uncertainty aware constraint learning method of decomposing a neural network into a set of mixed-integer linear constraints  \cite{ALCANTARA2023120895} \cite{ALCANTARA2025127876}. Similar approaches of embedding machine learning models into optimization problems have been taken for Decision Trees and Random Forests in \cite{preprintBonfiettiEmbeddDecisionTrees} or for Neural Networks(without integer variables required), as done in \cite{dealba2024reformulationembeddingneuralnetwork}. A survey performed by Fajemisin et al.\cite{FAJEMISIN20241} shows how the field is currently emerging with an increase in publications in recent years and most publications revolving around the Embedding of Neural Networks and Decision Trees/Random Forests.
