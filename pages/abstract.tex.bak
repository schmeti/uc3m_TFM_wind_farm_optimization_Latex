This thesis combines Linear Optimization with Constraint Learning to optimize wind turbine placement for maximum performance in a predefined area under randomly distributed wind. A Neural Network is trained on simulated data to model the impact of turbine positioning on power output. This model is integrated as a constraint in a linear optimization problem, and the problem evaluated for a current state-of-the-art wind farm configuration.
