# LaTeX template for HM theses

See [`main.pdf`][sample-pdf] for an example PDF created with this template.
## Quickstart

 * [Download][template-download] and extract the template, or upload it to an online editor such as [Overleaf][overleaf] or [ShareLaTeX][sharelatex]. If you prefer to use Git, just clone/fork the repository.
 * If your editor provides support for compiling LaTeX, set it up to use `pdflatex` and `biber`. Set the master document to `main.tex`.
 * Look for `TODO` comments in the provided files. Start at `main.tex`.

If you are new to LaTeX, the [ShareLaTeX knowledge base][sharelatex-kb] or the [LaTeX Wikibook][latex-wikibook] might help. A very short introduction is provided by [Learn X in Y minutes][learn-x-in-y].
